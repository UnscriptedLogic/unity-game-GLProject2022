  tips:
  - Not happy with your current map? Hit the pause button at the top left to generate
    a new one.
  - Consider leaving some feedback in the comments about the game! I'll gladly include
    you in a "Special Thanks" page in the future!
  - Careful when placing towers near intersections, newer units could block your
    tower's projectiles from hitting the units further up the track
  - You can regenerate the map in the pause menu
  - How's the game? Leave your thoughts and recommendations in the comment section
    of the Itch.io page!
  - More towers and enemies coming soon! Hang tight.
