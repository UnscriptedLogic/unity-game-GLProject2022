  towerDescription: "Enforcers are towers that have large range and high damage but
    lack the firing rate to keep up with faster targets. \n\nEnforcers are equipped
    with piercing shots that allow them to penetrate armored and boss enemies efficiently.
    In large groups, Enforcers are a force to be reckoned with."
