## Guided Learning Project
This is a game made for a school subject called 'Guided Learning' (GL) where a student takes a certain topic and intergrates it in any software whilst documenting their progress. For my GL, I fall under the students taking the Microsft Azure topic and have chosen to make a multiplayer game with Azure playfab. Due to my lack of experience making multiplayer games, this project would give me valuable experience to broaden my skillset as a game developer.

## Unnamed Tower Defense Game
This is a tower defense game much like any other but without the need to invest any time into getting better towers. One of the interesting twists of my game is that the map is procedurally generated, meaning you will be getting unique maps everytime you play the game.

Another interesting twist is that status affectors can be applied to any tower in the game and the effect of that status is dictated by the bullet's speed and damage. You could have a weak rapidly shooting tower that has a "Ice" affector that slows enemies or you could have a sniper tower that shoots high damage and low intervals but poisons the enemy, dealing damage every few seconds.
