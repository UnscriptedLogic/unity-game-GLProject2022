  towerDescription: 'Reliant on it''s burning capabilities, the Torch tower burns
    and decimates everyone in its radius, leaving almost everyone who dares to come
    close with a scalding reminder to never come back.


    Torchers were held as
    a highly valuable turret due to their effectiveness during the Slime Infestation.
    It could kill every slime unit, including it''s smaller variants, with fire in
    a matter of seconds.'
